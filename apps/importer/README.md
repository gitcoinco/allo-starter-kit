# importer

Welcome to the Allokit Importer!

this tool will import Allokit features into your application.


V1 todo list:

 [ ] get the code compiled into a bundle
 [ ] link this repo into a create-next-app and try it out until it imports into the right place
 [ ] clean up the code so it builds
 [ ] pull hardcoded config out of index.ts into JSON or something that it can be parsed as optional args
 [ ] add more mappings

## Development

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.23. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
